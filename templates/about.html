  <h2>About Me üë©‚Äçüíª</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! I‚Äôm <span class="highlight">Sharanya Lakshmi</span>, a final-year engineering student at <span class="highlight">Srinivasa Ramanujan Institute of Technology</span>, with a strong passion for <span class="highlight">Data Science, AI, and full-stack development</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm deeply fascinated by the power of data and how it drives smarter decisions in today‚Äôs world. My academic journey has been a blend of analytical thinking, coding, and creative exploration‚Äîfueling my ambition to become a successful <span class="highlight">Data Scientist</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've built several projects that reflect my technical interests‚Äîfrom building intelligent chatbots and weather-based crop monitoring dashboards to developing web applications using <span class="highlight">Flask, MongoDB, Tableau, and Python</span>. I love taking on real-world problems and solving them through clean, efficient code and data-driven insights.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm also gaining hands-on experience in platforms like <span class="highlight">ServiceNow</span> and tools like <span class="highlight">Git, VS Code, and Jupyter</span>, constantly upskilling myself to stay relevant in the fast-evolving tech landscape.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of tech, I enjoy reading about innovation in science, participating in hackathons, and connecting with like-minded learners. I believe in continuous learning and aspire to contribute meaningfully to impactful data science projects in the near future.
